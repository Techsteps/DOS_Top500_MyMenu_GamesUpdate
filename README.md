# DOS_Top500_MyMenu_GamesUpdate
 
This is a project space to work on autorun bats/configs for adding the Top 500 gameset that is here:https://github.com/flynnsbit/Top300_updates/blob/main/_mister/_Packlists/Top500.lst to Flynnsbit/BinaryBond007's amazing work in the Mister AO486 core.

Eventually there will be an Mister updater script that will provide autorun batch files and various other configs/setups for games to allow you to bring in more DOS games (perferablly from ExoDOS). This will not provide the games themselves or anything that could be considered commerically protected.

For now its mostly just going to be a worklog and repository of my progress.
